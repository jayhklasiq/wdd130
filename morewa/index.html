            <h1> Welocme to MoRewa Clothings</h1>
            <h2>MoRewa Clothing was created on the 11 of October 2022. Inspired by everyday slang and how people feel, MoRewa became a thing. Our first collection, titled "Angry Me," was born from a conversation between two good friends who found how to happily share how they felt when they were angry with each other.
    
                A few days later, the idea became a reality as Joshua Olaoye and Taite Hutchason made the sketch design for the "Angry Me" collection. 
                
                We are happy to share this project. We intend to help you share how you feel with your loved ones without resentment and in a loving way. We hope our collection becomes one of your favorite designs.
